# PineScript-168SMA-Indicator
This repository is a pinescript file for tradingview indicator of the 168 day SMA. The indicator provides a red chevron underneath candles when the 168 day SMA is below the current price trend, and a green chevron when above when the current price trend is greater than the 168 day SMA. Also, the most current signal is marked with chevron that says SMA Cross so that the most recent signal is not confused with pervious signals. 

I selected the 168 day SMA as after several 100 back tests for multiple strategies found that it provided more consisent returns for all asset classes when used with a well diverisfied portfolio.
